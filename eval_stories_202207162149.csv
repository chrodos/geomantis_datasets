1052;BS;"Foreign tourists complained of missed flights and appointments while islanders salvaged what they could on Saturday after Hurricane Lili ripped through the Bahamian island of San Salvador.The hurricane turned vacations in a Caribbean paradise to a holiday in hell. It ripped houses of roofs, snapped palm trees and strewed debris across the island but the worst passed on Saturday morning with no casualties reported.The attitude of the islanders, mostly poor folk engaged in fishing and crabbing if they do not work for the government or the tourist trade, seemed to be that Lili was very bad but could have been worse.""Everything has gone or is soaked,"" said Alicia Storr, sitting on the porch of her humble clapperboard house in Cockburn town. Her whole roof had been blown off.Clifton Pinder, standing alongside her, said, ""We are poor people, It's real bad news. It's the worst we've ever had.""We are coping quite well with it,"" he added. ""There's no electricity but we are mainly concerned with getting messages to Nassau to let family there know we are OK.""He said they hoped for government relief but there appeared to be no sign of an organised clean-up effort.People milled around salvaging items from floodwaters. Others drove by with possessions piled onto trucks, apparently returning from hurried evacuations.Many of the shabby, one-level houses in Cockburn were damaged and telegraph poles felled.Road signs wrenched from poles lay scattered around, but one still nailed to a tree read: ""Help keep San Salvador clean and beautiful"". It was surrounded by driftwood, cable and other rubbish from the storm.The pounding winds had deposited the shack that served as the airport control tower on the runway.Some islanders made the most of their plight.

1244;MX;"Mexicans on Thursday braced for possible violence in the troubled western state of Guerrero as the ruling party prepared to square off against the opposition in weekend elections.Armed rebels who have launched a series of attacks recently have promised to stay on the sidelines, but will keep a close eye on the elections.Tensions rose this week when leftist opposition leaders cried foul even before Sunday's contests to elect mayors and state legislators -- races that are expected to go mostly to the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).Guerrero's main opposition party, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), accused the PRI of waging a ""dirty war"" against its candidates and of buying votes with government money. The government denied the charges.Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has staked much of his credibility on cleaning up the country's notoriously dirty elections, a policy that will be put to the test in a state where PRI hardliners still control local political machinery.Analysts say the elections could determine whether Guerrero makes a peaceful transition to democracy or descends into ever-worsening political violence.The PRI is expected to retain power in most of the 76 town halls up for grabs, although its traditional grip on the state will be tested by an economic crisis and fairer state electoral rules imposed over the past few years.A top PRD official, Pablo Gomez, warned the government that dirty tricks would produce a climate in which ""the response to any kind of aggression against the popular vote could be very strong.""Closely watching the vote will be guerrillas of the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), a group which first appeared in Guerrero in June and have launched a series of attacks on the army in recent months.EPR rebels called a month-long ceasefire ahead of the election, but analysts fear a contested election could prompt new rebel attacks.Guarding against the EPR in the dirt-poor state, home to the glitzy resort of Acapulco, are thousands of army troops, who flooded into the state in the past few months in search of the elusive rebels.Human rights groups say voters will be intimidated by troops, although acting state Gov. Angel Aguirre said this week the army had been ordered to keep a low profile during Sunday's vote.Pre-electoral troubles have stirred an already volatile political climate in the state, where the gap between the glamour of Acapulco and the grim poverty of remote villages has led to a long history of violence.""In Guerrero there is a 30-year-old political battle that will not be resolved by Sunday's vote,"" wrote Sergio Aguayo, a respected Mexican human rights observer, in a column this week in Reforma newspaper.Aguayo noted that the EPR's first appearance this year came during the anniversary of a peasant massacre by police in the state during 1995. Opposition leaders say the massacre was the latest incident in a long history of repression in Guerrero.The PRD hopes to use Sunday's vote to regain some of the ground it has lost in recent years despite the economic crisis and low approval ratings for Zedillo.";GCAT,GPOL,GVIO,GVOTE;"96301";"";RCV1;2018-05-07 20:31:23.000;1;""

Leaders of the outlawed Solidarity labor union appealed again yesterday for talks with the Polish Government, a day after a range of emergency measures were instituted to halt a wave of labor disruptions. The Solidarity appeal came as large movements of military and police personnel and equipment were reported near the southern coal mining regions that have been the focal points of the strikes, which have spread across the nation. The workers are demanding that Solidarity be legalized again, and they want pay increases to offset a rise in the price of consumer goods.

An estimated 20,000 people marched silently through the streets today in a show of solidarity with the Roman Catholic Church. The march, organized by the church, came six days after the church said it was being persecuted by the Government. Agents of President Alfredo Stroessner, who has ruled since seizing power in a 1954 coup, watched the demonstration but did not intervene. No incidents were reported. Tensions between the Government and the church have risen since July 25, when a Spanish Jesuit priest, the Rev. Juan Antonio de la Vega, was expelled to neighboring Argentina; he was accused of publicly advocating the overthrow of the Government. Church officials denied the charge and said Father de la Vega, a 65-year-old theology professor, was explaining liberation theology, a movement that advocates political action to achieve social change.";"168641";PARAGUAY;"";NYT;2018-05-07 20:44:34.000;1;""
1777;TR;LEAD: A Turkish court has ruled that part of the country's new election procedure is unlawful, jeopardizing a general election scheduled in three weeks. A Turkish court has ruled that part of the country's new election procedure is unlawful, jeopardizing a general election scheduled in three weeks. The Constitutional Court in Ankara upheld a complaint Friday outlawing the procedure for selecting parliamentary candidates. The decision, not open to appeal, means that all candidates on party lists announced over the last few weeks are illegal and the lists must be redrawn under the old rules. Opposition groups say there is not enough time for this before the election Nov. 1. The vote, called by Prime Minister Turgut Ozal last month, a year ahead of schedule, is widely viewed as a step toward the revival of full democracy. Political Rights Restored Turks, by a narrow vote in a referendum Sept. 6, restored the political rights of former leaders banned from seeking office since the country's last military rule in 1980 to 1983. Under new election procedures, announced by Mr. Ozal a day after the referendum, political party leaderships were empowered to nominate candidates for the election. Previously, candidates were supposed to be selected in their constituencies by primaries or other tests of rank-and file sentiment. The change in electoral law was challenged by the Social Democratic Populist Party, the principal leftist opposition group in the 400-seat Parliament, which applied to the Constitutional Court to have eight aspects of the new procedures outlawed. The court upheld one of the eight complaints. Response by Prime Minister In an initial response to the ruling Friday, Mr. Ozal said the court had not outlawed the Nov. 1 election date and he declared that the vote would take place on that day. Critics of the Turkish leader said he had changed the rules because some of his candidates were reluctant to expose themselves to a need for grass-roots endorsement. Turkish commentators said Mr. Ozal's calculation was that his Motherland Party, the best-organized and biggest, with 250 of the 400 parliamentary seats, would be able to reselect its candidates by Nov. 1, while the less-organized opposition groups would not. The challenge to the new electoral law, Turkish commentators said, stemmed partly from apprehension that opposition groups, most of them in some form of disarray, would not have time to marshal support before Nov. 1 and thus wanted the vote postponed. Opposition spokesmen urged Mr. Ozal on Friday to reconvene Parliament and set a later date for the general election. The Turkish leader's insistence on Nov. 1, however, seemed to preclude such action. He has already refused earlier opposition demands to recall Parliament from a recess.;"81642";TURKEY;"";NYT;2018-05-07 20:44:35.000;1;""
1841;RO;"Anti-Government graffiti scrawled on building walls have become as much a part of Bucharest residents' lives as skyrocketing prices or daylong lines of cars waiting to buy gasoline. Yet Romanians have begun to ignore their political discontent in hopes of coping with their economic crisis. Whether the subject is marketable skills, the inventories of shops or the price of potatoes, economic discussions have replaced the spirited political debates that enlivened street corners and kitchen tables for over a year after the revolution in December 1989 that overthrew the Ceausescu dictatorship. ""People see their standard of living falling day by day,"" said Vasile Pilat, an economist. ""They are buying less, maybe 200 or 300 grams of sausage instead of the kilogram they used to bring home for dinner. But that's not enough. They also have to think of how they can work differently, adding on longer hours or more jobs."" Mr. Pilat had just returned home from the state television station, where he had participated in a three-hour discussion of Romania's economy that was carried live to a national prime time audience. How much the new focus on economic life has been inspired by the new Prime Minister, Theodor Stolojan, is anyone's guess. Mr. Stolojan took over the top Government post in September after miners from the Jiu Valley, a center of frequent labor unrest, marched on Bucharest and demanded the resignation of Petre Roman, who had won election as Prime Minister in May 1990 on the same National Salvation Front ticket with President Ion Iliescu. In just three months in office, Mr. Stolojan has impressed Romanians by his serious approach to economic reform. They also give the quiet economist high marks for having forsworn politics -- refusing to run for office in the elections scheduled for April 1992 -- to concentrate on the economy. Mr. Stolojan's Government introduced strict monetary control on enterprises in November, requiring all businesses to keep their accounts in the Romanian currency, the lei, and turn over their hard currency holdings to the state in return for the equivalent in lei. The move came in response to a catastrophic shortage of energy, and an accompanying shortage of hard currency in the National Bank, that together had left the country in the beginning of November with about three weeks' worth of energy reserves. According to Mr. Pilat, the National Bank raised about $500 million through the scheme. The lack of energy is evident throughout the economy. Industry is working at about 50 percent of capacity, not only because of the energy shortage but also because of shortfalls in raw materials supplies. Airplanes that used to travel twice a day between Bucharest and provincial cities now fly three times a week. Home heating is irregular, with entire neighborhoods in the capital shivering day and night, and public buildings are barely heated as a rule. Between October 1990 and October 1991, official figures report, the country's inflation ran at about 350 percent. Wages rose by 283 percent during the period, while purchases fell by 28 percent. The Government meets often with union representatives, and has vowed to maintain some price supports, including subsidies for housing, to cushion the economic hardship.";"493488";ROMANIA;"";NYT;2018-05-07 20:44:57.000;1;""

1949;MM;"Members of the Burmese opposition have declared a rival government and denounced the country's military rulers for failing to hand over power to the opposition, which won free elections seven months ago. ""Burma has become a country shrouded by darkness because of all the unlawful arrests, tortures and persecutions and human rights violations,"" the dissidents said in a declaration issued on Tuesday and seen in Bangkok today. Diplomats in Yangon, the capital, said they feared that the move could prompt a new crackdown by the military Government, which changed the country's official name to Myanmar in 1989. The dissidents, calling themselves the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, said they had picked U Sein Win as prime minister. He is a cousin of Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader whose National League for Democracy won 80 percent of the parliamentary seats contested in May's national election. She has been under house arrest since July 1989, and her party has not been allowed to govern. Most of the party's leaders have been detained since the army took power by crushing a nationwide movement for democracy in 1988. Mr. Sein Win said forming the new body ""was the only option for us to choose because this military junta has no will and no way to transfer power to the people."" The announcement of the formation of a new government was made at the headquarters of the Karen National Union in Manerplaw, about 120 miles northeast of Yangon. The Karen are an ethnic rebel group that has fought Burmese governments since the 1940's. The dissidents named an eight-member cabinet, all of whom had won parliamentary seats in the election. Six are League members, and one is an independent. Sein Win is a member of the National Democracy Party. The dissidents called for the immediate elimination of the military administration, a national convention including members of Parliament and insurgent groups, and the establishment of a democratic government. Troops killed thousands of people crushing the pro-democracy movement in 1988. A Yangon-based diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday that the declaration of a rival government could give the military an excuse to intensify its crackdown on the opposition. Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, Myanmar's head of military intelligence, told The Bangkok Post in an interview published Tuesday that the proclamation of a rival government would be ""a great mistake.""";"409809";MYANMAR;"";NYT;2018-05-07 20:44:58.000;1;""

1980;PL;LEAD: A Polish court opened hearings today into charges that the chief Government spokesman slandered four Polish citizens by asserting that they had subversive ties to an official of the United States Embassy. A Polish court opened hearings today into charges that the chief Government spokesman slandered four Polish citizens by asserting that they had subversive ties to an official of the United States Embassy. It was the first time a court in postwar Poland had accepted such a suit, reflecting the gradual introduction of the right of legal appeal against what were once considered unchallengeable actions and decrees of the Communist Government. The case involves a charge raised by the spokesman, Jerzy Urban, at a news conference last April. He said Polish investigators had supplied him with firm evidence that four noted Polish academicians usually linked with the political opposition held secret meetings with Albert Mueller, a second secretary in the political section of the United States Embassy. The Polish authorities had accused Mr. Mueller of espionage. #2 Are Solidarity Advisers The four - Magdalena Sokolowska, a professor of sociology at Warsaw University, Klemens Szaniawski, a logician, Bronislaw Geremek, a historian, and Janusz Onyszkiewicz, a mathematician - denied ever having met the American diplomat. They sued Mr. Urban for slander. Mr. Geremek and Mr. Onyszkiewicz are both senior advisers to the outlawed Solidarity union. The diplomat later left Poland and the Polish authorities took no formal action against him. Mr. Urban did not attend today's hearing, and the court adjourned until November to allow his counsel time to prepare its defense. The final decision could rest with one of two courts created since 1980, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Constitutional Tribunal, which are designed to allow civilian challenges to governmental actions. About 13,000 cases were heard in 1986 by the Administrative Court, and citizens' suits succeeded in more than a third of them.But the Government's critics view the new institutions as a shams established to persuade Western governments that democratic procedures are being installed. When the hearings resume in November, the court is empowered to force Mr. Urban to attend and substantiate his claims. If it finds him guilty, the court could fine him, or order him to retract his statement and offer a public apology.;"85280";POLAND;"";NYT;2018-05-07 20:44:58.000;1;""
